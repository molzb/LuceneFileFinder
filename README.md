# LuceneFileFinder

Sample project which uses the Lucene API (lucene.apache.org).

Launch the app: http://h1881812.stratoserver.net:8080/LuceneFileFinder/

Dependencies Java: Lombok, Lucene, Jackson
Dependencies Web: AngularJS 1.4

Example web app, where you can use the Lucene Library to
find files on a hard disk. The files on the hard disk has
been indexed before by Lucene to enable fast searches.

Don't expect it to behave exactly like Windows Search, when
it comes to jokers and wildcards. This webapp is just to
demonstrate Lucene searches.
